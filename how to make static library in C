How to make a static library in C:

1. create the C files and put the functions in them.
For example, we have add.c file containing this code:
int add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

2. Now it's time to create the object files:
gcc -c add.c   (-c means just compile it)

3. Next, we create a archive with this command:
ar rs libbasic.a add.o ...  (it's very important to start its name with lib and end it with .a)

4. Now it's time to create the header file:
for example, I have the basic.h file here:
int add(int, int);  (here we only need the signature of the functions)

5. Now we can remove .o files and .c files

6. It's time to use our library. First, let's create the main.c file and compile it:
gcc -c main.c

7. Now, it's time to generate the output file:
    a. we can use this command:
        gcc -o test main.o libbasic.a
    
    b. or alternatively this command:
        gcc -o test -L . main.o -lbasic  (basic is the name of our library, and . means it's available in current directory)
