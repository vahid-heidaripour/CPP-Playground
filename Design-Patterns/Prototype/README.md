### Prototype design pattern
### Intent:
    - creating an object is expensive operation than copy an object
    - All objects initial state is common and takes time to build
    - composition, creation, and representation of objects should be decoupled from the system
    - hide the complexity of creating new instance from the user
    - which classes to create are specified at runtime
