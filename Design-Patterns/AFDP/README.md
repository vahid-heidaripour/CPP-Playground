### Abstract Factory Design Pattern
AFDP defines an abstract class for creating families of related objects but without specifying their concrete sub-class.
### Why / When to use AFDP
    - you need system to be independent of how objects are created, composed and represented
    - show interface not implementation
    - system need to be configured with one of the multiple family of objects
