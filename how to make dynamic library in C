First, we write our functions in file, for example add.c and mul.c

Next, compile these files.
gcc -fPIC -c add.c  (PIC stands for position independent code, which means we can call it in any address in memory)
gcc -fPIC -c mul.c

Now that we have two object files, it's time to create dynamic library:
gcc -shared -o libbasic.so add.o mul.o

Now we will generate executable file, but first let's generate the object file for main.c:
gcc -c main.c

gcc -o demo main.o libbasic.so

Next, we need to install the dynamic library:
mv libbasic.so /usr/lib/

after that run ldconfig

now we can execute our program.
